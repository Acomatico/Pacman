#PACMAN

Small Pacman I created on python and pygame as a fun challenge, As my first time working with pygame I looked another pacman to draw some inspiration from [here](https://github.com/janjilecek/pacman_python_pygame/blob/main/pacman.py), although it ended up being quite different as I only needed some pointers for how pygame works/structure/etc.
